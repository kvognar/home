        |  A game jam project I made with Laurel, Lee, Ian, and Jeff. The jam was the 2023 GMTK Game Jam, with a
        |  theme of "Roles Reversed". It's a reverse-shoot-em-up in which you play as the final boss against a
        |  tiny spaceshipâ€”but you are an intern on your first day, and you've been left alone at the helm while
        |  your supervisor attends a meeting. Nobody taught you how the ship works, so it's up to you to figure it
        |  out on the job.

        |  I had such a good time making this weird game come to life. With more time I would arrange the dialogue
        |  so it's less easy to miss, give better feedback on your progress through the game, and of course add
        |  an additional battery of gadgets and weapons to fiddle with while you scramble to deal with the interloper.
        |  I'm kind of fascinated with the idea of slowly learning how a machine works and how to control it, so I
        |  would love to return to something like this in the future.

		|  In 2016, Laurel and I did a little game jam together to make a Pico-8 game that tells a story.
		|  Our idea was a little ambitious for our ability at the time, and we started building
		|  before really deciding what the game was going to <em>be</em>, so it didn't coalesce into
		|  anything in particular during that jam, or in the next year, or in the year after that.
		|  But I liked the setting and I liked the characters enough to keep coming
		|  back to it, so every year I spent a few hours tinkering until it finally became something
		|  I was willing to share with you.
      p
		| It's a silly little game about talking to ghosts. There's some weirdos in there, but they're
		|  good souls.

        |  A tiny game made for the Pico-8 #{link_to 'Collab16 Jam', 'http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=27582'}, in which
        |  16 developers were tasked to create 16 games that would fit together on a single Pico-8 cartridge. That means
        |  no more than 512 tokens apiece - a constraint that required us to shave our games down to only the most vital
        |  components. It's a lot of fun to work within these limits, to be pushed to find alternate ways of expressing
        |  ideas; it makes you appreciate what developers had to deal with back in the NES days.

        |  The game is simple - use the left and right keys to boop as many bubbles as you can!

        | You are Jonathan, a meek demon spy sent to collect Heaven's magical relic. When combined with the one in Hell, it will create the ultimate weapon. The game starts after Jonathan has already infiltrated Heaven and stolen the relic - now take a leap and make your way back home!

        | We built this in two days with almost no experience in Pico-8, and made it to the halfway point in our plan. Someday, perhaps, you'll get to play Act II.

        |  A little chess game built with the Tk GUI toolkit. Boot it up from your terminal! You can click to select a piece and move it, and you can save and load games, but we never implemented castling, pawn promotion or
        span.italic  en passant.
        |  But it's mostly chess!

        |  This is a single-stage platforming game I built with Processing in my first programming class. The assignment was to write a program that used arrays; I was so excited about my newly discovered love of coding that I went ahead and built a game, writing object classes and inheritance and my own collision detection system. #{time_ago_in_words(Time.parse('May 2012')).capitalize} have passed since then and the code is starting to look a little rough around the edges, but it still plays nicely and I have a certain fondness for it.
